					<h2 class='article' href="">Art History Lab</h2>
					<p class='p section'><a href="http://people.ucls.uchicago.edu/~bwildem/art_history_lab.html">Art History Lab</a> is a curricular site for the <a href="">AT</a> course that I teach, as well as a general resource for anybody interested in the subject.  The site is broken into three volumes and arranged chronologically, according to region and style.  I've written most of it, but in the past two years, I've included sections written by my students. The Slide ID Challenge sections operate like flashcards.  Try identifying the date, style, artist, and patron for each button in the side bar before clicking on it. </p>

					<p class='p section'>Design Communication class is a fairly new course offering at Lab, and a class that I have been developing over the last few years. The course covers pixel and vector-based graphics, publication design, web design and 3-D modeling.  Web design is a fundamental aspect of the class that we work on throughout the year.  This website serves both as a curricular course guide, and as a gallery of student work.</p>

Traditional, historical, and contemporary concepts and techniques of painting, drawing, mixed-media, and three- dimensional art will be explored. The purpose is to develop ideas and skills that will bring about a better understanding of art and enhance the personal visual statements of the student.</p>
